### [The Box Model](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-the-box-model)

#### Introduction

    The most important skills you need to master with CSS are positioning
and layout. Changing fonts and colors is a crucial skill, but being able to
put things exactly where you want them on a webpage is even more crucial.

#### Lesson Overview

    - You’ll learn all about the box model.
    - You’ll learn how to make sure elements are just the right size with
        margin, padding, and borders
  
#### The Box Model
    - Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can
        have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another. You can
        get a rough idea of how this works by sticking a border on every item
        on the page like this:
----
* {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
----

#### Assignment

1. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIO5326FgPE) is a straightforward overview of the box model, padding and margin. Go ahead and watch this now; it informs everything else.
2. Because the box model concept is so incredibly fundamental, check out [this lesson from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model). It covers the same material as the video above, but it goes a little further in-depth. Pay close attention to the examples and take the time to experiment with their in-browser editor!
3. [This CSS Tricks page](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/margin/) has some further information about the margin property that you’ll find useful. Specifically, the sections about auto and margin collapsing contain things you’ll want to know.



#### Knowledge Check

  - From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
  - What does the box-sizing CSS property do?
  - What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
  - Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?
  - Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?
  - Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?
