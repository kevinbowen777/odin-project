    Being able to inspect and debug your HTML and CSS is critical to frontend

allow you to see detailed information about your elements and CSS rules, 
as well as assist you in finding and fixing problems in your code.

======================
Learning Outcomes

    To open up the inspector, you can right-click on any element of a webpage
        and click “Inspect Element” or press F12.

Assignment
======================
1. Go through the following sections of the official Chrome DevTools docs:
    https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools
    - Overview:
        Don’t navigate to any other pages linked here; just get familiar with
            what tools are available in the DevTools, rather than how to use
            all of them right now.
    - Open Chrome DevTools:
            Similar to what we went over above, but with some nice extras.
    - CSS:
            Be sure to follow along with any interactive instructions! Note
                that while you haven’t used CSS Grid yet, you should still
                read the “Inspect CSS Grid” section to be familiar with how
                to inspect it in case you see it in the wild.
    - Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM:
            Skip through any part that uses the JavaScript console.
