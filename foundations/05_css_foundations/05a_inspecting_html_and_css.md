### [Inspecting HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-inspecting-html-and-css)

#### Introduction
    Being able to inspect and debug your HTML and CSS is critical to frontend
development. This lesson will take us through the Chrome Dev Tools, which
allow you to see detailed information about your elements and CSS rules, 
as well as assist you in finding and fixing problems in your code.

#### Lesson Overview
 
    - You will know how to access the element inspector.
    - You will know how to select and inspect specific elements.
    - You will know how to test out HTML and CSS in the inspector.
  
#### The Inspector
#### Inspecting Elements
#### Testing Styles In The Inspector

#### Assignment

1. Go through the following sections of the official Chrome DevTools docs:
    https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools
    - Overview:
        Don’t navigate to any other pages linked here; just get familiar with
            what tools are available in the DevTools, rather than how to use
            all of them right now.
    - Open Chrome DevTools:
            Similar to what we went over above, but with some nice extras.
    - CSS:
            Be sure to follow along with any interactive instructions! Note
                that while you haven’t used CSS Grid yet, you should still
                read the “Inspect CSS Grid” section to be familiar with how
                to inspect it in case you see it in the wild.
    - Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM:
            Skip through any part that uses the JavaScript console.
