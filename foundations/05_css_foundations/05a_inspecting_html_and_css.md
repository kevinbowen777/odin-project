### [Inspecting HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-inspecting-html-and-css)

### Introduction
    Being able to inspect and debug your HTML and CSS is critical to frontend
development. This lesson will take us through the Chrome Dev Tools, which
allow you to see detailed information about your elements and CSS rules, 
as well as assist you in finding and fixing problems in your code.

### Lesson Overview
 
  - You will know how to access the element inspector.
  - You will know how to select and inspect specific elements.
  - You will know how to test out HTML and CSS in the inspector.
  
### The Inspector

To open up the inspector, you can right-click on any element of a webpage and
click "Inspect Element" or press **F12**.

### Inspecting Elements

In the Elements pane, you can see the entire HTML structure of your page. You
can click on any of the elements in this pane to select that specific element.
Alternatively, you can click on the blue-highlighted icon, and hover over any
element on the page.

When an element is selected, the Styles tab will show all the currently applied
styles, as well as any styles that are being overwritten(indicated by a strikethrough
of the text).

### Testing Styles In The Inspector

The styles pane also allows you to edit styles directly in the browser. You can
click inside of any individual selector to add a new rule or click on an
existing attribute or value to alter it.

This _won't_ affect the source code in your text editor, but it is extremely 
useful for quickly testing out various attributes and values without needing
to reload the page over and over again.

### Assignment

1. Go through the following sections of the [official Chrome DevTools docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools):

  - [Overview](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/):
    Don’t navigate to any other pages linked here; just get familiar with
    what tools are available in the DevTools, rather than how to use
    all of them right now.
  - [Open Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/):
    Similar to what we went over above, but with some nice extras.
  - [View and change CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css):
    Be sure to follow along with any interactive instructions!
  - [Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/):
    Skip through any part that uses the JavaScript console.
