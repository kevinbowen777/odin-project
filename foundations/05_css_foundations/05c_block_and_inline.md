#### Assignment


1. The concept of “Normal flow” is implied in the box-model resources, but isn’t laid out very specifically. Read [“Normal Flow”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow) from MDN to make sure you understand how elements lay themselves out by default.
2. W3 schools’ [“HTML Block and Inline Elements”](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) has a description and a list of all the default block and inline elements.
3. The Digital Ocean tutorial [“Inline vs Inline-block Display in CSS”](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block) has a couple of great examples that clarify the difference between inline and inline-block.
4. Go to our [CSS exercises repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) and do “01-margin-and-padding-1” and “02-margin-and-padding-2” in the margin-and-padding directory.
