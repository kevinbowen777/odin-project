#### Lesson Overview:

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

  - Explain what Git and GitHub are and the differences between the two.
  - Describe the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping.
  - Describe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers.

#### Assignment

1. Read Chapter 1.1 through 1.4 in [this book about version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)*
to learn the differences between local, centralized, and distributed version control
systems.
2. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo) about how Git can improve the workflow of both an
individual and a team of developers.
3. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h9_cB9mPT8&feature=youtu.be&t=13s)
for some history on Git and GitHub, and make sure you know the difference
between the two. Git is a technology used in the command line while GitHub
is a [website](https://github.com/) you can visit.
4. If you haven’t yet installed Git, visit the [Setting Up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git)
lesson.
5. Take a look at The Odin Project’s very own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum).
This is where all the lessons are stored! While you’re there, look at all our 
[contributors](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/graphs/contributors)
to gain an appreciation for how Git records all collaborative efforts and how
GitHub visually represents this.
