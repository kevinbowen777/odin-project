### [DOM Manipulations and Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events)

### Introduction
### Lesson Overview

  - Explain what the DOM is in relation to a webpage.
  - Explain the difference between a “node” and an “element”.
  - Explain how to target nodes with “selectors”.
  - Explain the basic methods for finding/adding/removing and altering DOM nodes.
  - Explain the difference between a “nodelist” and an “array of nodes”.
  - Explain what “bubbling” is and how it works.

### DOM - Document Object Model
### Targeting Nodes with Selectors
### DOM Methods
#### Query Selectors
#### Element Creation
#### Append Elements
#### Remove Elements
#### Altering Elements
#### Adding Inline Style
#### Editing Attributes
#### Working with Classes
#### Adding Text Content
#### Adding HTML Content

### Exercise
### Events
#### Method 1
#### Method 2
#### Method 3
#### Attaching Listeners to Groups of Nodes

### Assignment

1. Grab the first exercise in Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 program by cloning the repo at https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30. Code along with the [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego) to build the rest of the exercise.
2. Watch the [Event Capture, Propagation and Bubbling video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1anRyL37lE) from Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 program. If you want to code along with the video, you can use the contents of folder #25 from the repo you cloned above.
