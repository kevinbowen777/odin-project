### Assignment

To give you a good bit of practice, we have created some replit.com exercises for you to play with. We believe that it’s best to practice programming on your own computer, rather than in an online environment, but we’ll get to that soon enough.

Be sure to do the lessons in order presented here. Pressing “run” at the top will run the code. Read all directions, watch the terminal, and read all the errors. Don’t forget to use ‘console.log’ extensively.

To get started, create a free replit account and click “Fork” or “Remix” in order to have access to the exercises. Note: Feel free to browse the files on the left column in order to gain familiarity with it.

  - [Exercise 1](https://replit.com/@I3uckwheat/troubleshooting#troubleshooting.js)
  - In this exercise, you will be working out of the file called troubleshooting.js
  - [Exercise 2](https://replit.com/@I3uckwheat/enter-a-number#script.js)
  - You will be working out of script.js, and you will use the console in the ‘webview’ pane to check your work. To access the console, click the wrench icon, which is located on the right side of the address bar within the ‘webview’ pane.
  - [Exercise 3](https://replit.com/@I3uckwheat/lets-do-some-math#math.js)
  - You will be working out of math.js
  - [Exercise 4](https://replit.com/@I3uckwheat/direction-follow#follow.js)
  - You will be working out of follow.js

### Additional Resources

  - Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are a tool that matches or locates patterns in strings for string validation. Although it shouldn’t be your immediate solution this early on, you can still use this resource to understand how websites know that myemail@com isn’t a valid email address. On top of that, other solutions to filter out strings exist, and regex is considered a slow operation.
