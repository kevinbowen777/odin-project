### [Fundamentals Part 4]](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-4)

### Introduction
### Lesson Overview

  - Using arrays.
  - Using built-in array methods.
  - Using loops.
  - Getting your hands dirty with TDD exercises.

### Arrays
### Loops
### Test Driven Development

### Assignment

1. Set up the files and Jest by carefully following the directions in the repository’s README.
2. Now that you have cloned the repository and run `npm install` to install Jest, complete these exercises in the following order:
   - helloWorld (This exercise is intentionally very simple to ensure that you have set up everything properly!)
   - repeatString
   - reverseString
   - removeFromArray
   - sumAll
   - leapYears
   - tempConversion
3. Once you have a working solution, see how it compares to the exercise’s given solution. Solutions for the exercises can be found on the ‘solutions’ branch of the repo.
