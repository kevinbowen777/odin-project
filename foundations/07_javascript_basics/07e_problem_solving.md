### [Problem Solving](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving)


### Introduction
### Lesson Overview

  - Explain the three steps in the problem solving process.
  - Explain what pseudocode is and be able to use it to solve problems.
  - Be able to break a problem down into subproblems.

### Understand the Problem
### Plan
### Pseudocode
### Divide and Conquer
### Solving Fizz Buzz
### Understand the Problem
#### Plan
#### Divide and Conquer(Implement)

### Assignment

  - Read [How to Think Like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/) by Richard Reis.
  - Watch [How to Begin Thinking Like a Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k) by Coding Tech. It’s an hour long but packed full of information and definitely worth your time watching.
  - Read this [What is Pseudocoding](https://web.archive.org/web/20211229231605/https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/what-is-pseudo-coding) article from The Viking Code School.


### Knowledge Check

  - What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
  - Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
  - What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
  - What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
  - What is an algorithm?
  - What is pseudocode?
  - What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

### Additional Resources

  - Read [Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1540326000&sr=8-3&keywords=think+like+a+programmer) (not free). This book’s examples are in C++, but you will understand everything since the main idea of the book is to teach programmers to better solve problems. It’s an amazing book and worth every penny. It will make you a better programmer.
