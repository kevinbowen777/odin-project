## I. Introduction

The Odin Project is an open-source community dedicated to providing the best
learning resource to take you from zero experience to a full-stack developer.
More information can be found at The Odin Project's [about page](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)

We will learn about how the web works and start thinking about the basics of
computer and web programming.

Each of the sections and lessons represents essential _baseline_ knowledge.

### Objectives:

- Understand how the WWW works
- Identify and differentiate between all of the technology used in this course.
- Build a simple web page, style it, and add elements of interactivity.

## How this Course Will Work

The curriculum consists of curated content from across the Internet and
provides a useful context for understanding the resources.

Everything in the curriculum is intentionally included and vital to becoming
a successful programmer.

DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING!

## II. [Introduction to Web Development](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-web-development)


Web developers build and maintain websites. The work could involve front-end,
back-end, or full-stack web development. Many aspects of web development 
involve solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting
with new technologies.

For more details, Wikipedia describes the breadth of the web development
profession in their [entry on web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design)

### Types of Web Developers

  - front end
 
           What you see in your browser, including the presentation of content
            and user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front-end
            developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks
            to ensure that content is presented effectively and provide a
            positive user experience.
 
 - back end
  
          Refers to the internal workings of an application. The back end
            stores and serves program date to ensure the front end has what it
            needs. Back-end developers uses programming languages like Java,
            Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to work with data.

  - full-stack

          Developers who are comfortable working with both the front and 
            back ends of a web application covering all aspects of web development.

### Types of Careers

 - Large tech companies
 - Startups
 - Freelance
 - Consultant

### Tools of the Trade

 - Computer
 - Search Engine
 - Text Editor

### Motivation

    The strongest assests to have are a desire to build, a problem-solving
    mindset, and persistence in the face of setbacks.

### Why Odin?
   
    The Odin Project takes a realistic view of what you need to know and has
    you set up and work in your own environment.
    
    It acknowledges that you need a wide variety of skillsets and languages
    to reach an employable level.

    The Odin Project is constantly evolving because of people like you who
    get further along in the curriculum and pay it forward by incrementally
    improving our content over time.

   Once you start to feel comfortable with the tools, start hacking on open
    source projects [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/contributing)

    The more you contribute, the more you will learn about what you can do.

### Conclusion

    In this “Foundations” course, you’ll take a journey through the entire
    spectrum of topics that you will eventually need to know. This course
    jumps around to a variety of topics that you may be totally unfamiliar
    with, providing you a small taste of each and then moving on.

    The following courses will dive deep into these topics. You will build
    dozens of scripts, projects, and websites to cement those skills that 
    will make you a skilled, competant programmer.

## III. [Motivation and Mindset](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset)

Things that will help you succeed in your goal of learning to code and the
pitfalls that you should try to avoid.

### Motivation

  - Do you want to have a fufilling career that pays well?
  - Are you excited by the creative outlet programming provides?
  - Are you determined to develop the skills and abilities to build an app
  you can think of?
  - Do you want to start your own company by turning an app idea into reality?
  
Whatever it is, this will be what pulls you through to the end of the journey,
giving you a definitive goal to aim towards.

### Growth Mindset

Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself _any_ new skills, not
just programming. Your mindset will have more of an impact on your chances of
success than just about anything else.

Intelligence is _not_ fixed but can, instead, be developed. Someone with a
growth mindset believes they can get better at anythin with effort and
persistence.

Struggling with something is growth. It doesn't matter how long you struggle
with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and
tenacity to see it through. That's how real learning happens.

Embrace the struggles you encounter with difficult concepts and complex projects.
Celebrate your persistence at overcoming those struggles!

When you find yourself questioning your abilities, reflect on the successes
you have already acheived while learning: the projects that you have completed
and the concepts you once didn't understand but now do.

### The Learning Process

Learning concepts and then practicing them will help you to more fully
understand how things work and fit together. Projects are the ultimate method
for ensuring that your theoretical understanding aligns with how programming
concepts and techniques actually operate.

When learning, your mind will consistently switch between focus mode and
diffuse mode. __Focus mode__ occurs when you are consciously focusing on
learning, reading, watching videos, or working on a project. __Diffuse mode__
occurs subconsciously, at times when you are _not_ actively learning, such as
when you are doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping. In this state, your
mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the
other things you know. This is where breakthroughs happen.

When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your
subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a solution
to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first
and then take a break.

### What to Do When You’re Stuck

  - Search the web: You can be certain someone else out there has encountered
  the same problem as you at some point. A quick web search can often lead to
  a solution.
  - Take a break: Allow your diffuse learning state to work on the problem.
  - Ask in a chat: Come prepared with your research. People will be more willing
  to help you when they see you have already put effort into trying to figure
  out the solution on your own.
  
### Manage your study time

You will have more success with Odin by putting consistent time into it
rather than working on it once a week. Building a habit of studying every day
at a specific time and with a specific goal will ensure that you make
consistent progress.

### Pitfalls to avoid

#### __Procrastination__

Procrastination will be your biggest enemy when trying to make progress.

__Solution__:
  - [The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

#### __Not taking breaks__

Read [this article](https://simpleprogrammer.com/taking-breaks-will-boost-productivity/)
for more information on breaks & productivity.

#### __Digital Distractions__

#### __Physical Distractions__

#### __Rabbit Holes__

__Solution__: Stick to the path laid out as much as possible. Try to limit
time spent going down rabbit holes as these sidetracks can really ruin your momentum.

#### Comparing Yourself to Others
Only compare yourself to your past self. Be proud of the progress you have made.
