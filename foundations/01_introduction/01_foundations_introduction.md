## II. [Introduction to Web Development](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-web-development)


Web developers build and maintain websites. The work could involve front-end,
back-end, or full-stack web development. Many aspects of web development 
involve solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting
with new technologies.

For more details, Wikipedia describes the breadth of the web development
profession in their [entry on web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design)

### Types of Web Developers

  - front end
 
           What you see in your browser, including the presentation of content
            and user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front-end
            developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks
            to ensure that content is presented effectively and provide a
            positive user experience.
 
 - back end
  
          Refers to the internal workings of an application. The back end
            stores and serves program date to ensure the front end has what it
            needs. Back-end developers uses programming languages like Java,
            Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to work with data.

  - full-stack

          Developers who are comfortable working with both the front and 
            back ends of a web application covering all aspects of web development.

    The strongest assests to have are a desire to build, a problem-solving
    mindset, and persistence in the face of setbacks.

### Why Odin?
   
    The Odin Project takes a realistic view of what you need to know and has
    you set up and work in your own environment.
    
    It acknowledges that you need a wide variety of skillsets and languages
    to reach an employable level.

    The Odin Project is constantly evolving because of people like you who
    get further along in the curriculum and pay it forward by incrementally
    improving our content over time.

   Once you start to feel comfortable with the tools, start hacking on open
    source projects [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/contributing)

    The more you contribute, the more you will learn about what you can do.

### Conclusion

    In this “Foundations” course, you’ll take a journey through the entire
    spectrum of topics that you will eventually need to know. This course
    jumps around to a variety of topics that you may be totally unfamiliar
    with, providing you a small taste of each and then moving on.

    The following courses will dive deep into these topics. You will build
    dozens of scripts, projects, and websites to cement those skills that 
    will make you a skilled, competant programmer.
