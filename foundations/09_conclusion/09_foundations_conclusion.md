### [Choose Your Path Forward](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-choose-your-path-forward)

### Introduction

### Ruby and Ruby on Rails

    Opinionated
        You don’t have to make decisions on the structure of your projects. This helps when moving into projects built by others.
        You will learn things “The Ruby Way”, which can help you write clean code in other languages as well.
    Elegant
        Brings a lot of tools to help you develop things in a way that makes your code easy to read.
        Often times, solutions in Ruby are much more concise than other languages.
    Rapid development
        Rails helps you build applications very quickly. This means you can make a greater number of interesting projects than others in the same time frame.
    Single paradigm
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the Ruby way; many other languages are primarily OOP-based.

### JavaScript - Node & Express

    Un-opinionated
        There is no standard way of doing things. You are going to have to decide the structure of projects yourself, for better or worse.
    Very fast
        Because JavaScript utilises JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation, it can do calculations very quickly.
    Verbose
        There is no magic involved with these technologies. You will have to understand everything to make sense of it.
        Helps you get closer to how the computer is actually reading your code.
    Same language on both front end and back end
        Keeping the language consistent can help with writing consistent code across your entire application.
        Allows you to do some cool things, like writing code that runs on both the browser and the server for optimization purposes.
