### [Introduction to HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-html-and-css)

#### Introduction

*HTML* and *CSS* are the two foundational building blocks of pretty much everything
of the web.

#### Lesson Overview

  - Get a basic overview of HTML, CSS and how they work together.
  
#### HTML and CSS

  - _HTML_ - **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
  - _CSS_ - **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets

**HTML** is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links,
cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. **CSS** is what adds style to 
those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions
that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!

Both languages are only concerned with presenting information. They are
not used to program any logic.

1. HTML: Content & Layout

    HTML is a language that determines how documents and web pages are displayed in a web browser, the language for the building blocks of any website. 

2. CSS: Styling and “Look & Feel”

    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a popular style sheet language that determines how a document created in HTML is styled (colors, font styles, layout and responsive features). 

3. JavaScript: Interactive Elements

    JavaScript allows you to change CSS and HTML elements on your website after the site has been loaded, which gives you the ability to make your site more interactive and engaging for users.

4. What Can You Do With Each Programming Language?

    With HTML, you will be able to create the structure of your website.
    
    CSS gives you the ability to make the website look more visually appealing.
    
    As for JavaScript, this is a robust programming language that allows you to effectively change the HTML and CSS components of your website to match your specifications precisely.
