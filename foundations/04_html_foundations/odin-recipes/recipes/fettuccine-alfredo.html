    Begin by cooking the pasta according to the package instructions. Next, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Grate garlic directly into butter, and let mingle for about two minutes. Stir in heavy cream, salt and pepper, then simmer for three minutes. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot pasta water and continue to simmer for two more minutes. Thereâ€™s a bit more whisking to do. Whisk in grated parmesan, and continue whisking until melted.
