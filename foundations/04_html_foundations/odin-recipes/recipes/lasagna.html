    <h3>A faster, delicious, and less expensive lasagna</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>Lasagne</strong><em>(US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, also UK: /ləˈzænjə/,[1] 
  Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]</em>; singular <strong>lasagna</strong>, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]) are a type of <em>pasta</em>, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as <em>ragù</em> (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include <em>ricotta</em>, <em>mozzarella</em>, and <em>parmesan</em>), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.
    </p>
    <p>
    The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
  Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then 
  baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.
