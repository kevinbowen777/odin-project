    <h3>This made-from-scratch baked mac and chees only takes three simple
      steps.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni noodles, cooked</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (10-oz.) block extra sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Prepare pasta according to package
        directions.</li>
      <li>Microwave milk at HIGH for 1 ½ minutes. Melt butter in a large
        skillet or Dutch oven over medium-low heat; whisk in flour until smooth.
        Cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Gradually whisk in warm milk, and
        cook, whisking constantly, 5 minutes or until thickened.</li>
      <li>Whisk in salt, black pepper, 1 cup shredded cheese, and, if desired,
        red pepper until smooth; stir in hot cooked pasta. Spoon pasta mixture
        into a lightly greased 2-qt. baking dish prepped with cooking spray; top
        with remaining cheese. Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes or until golden and
        bubbly.</li>
