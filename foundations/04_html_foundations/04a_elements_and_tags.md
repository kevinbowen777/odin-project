#### Elements and Tags

Almost all *elements* on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in
opening and closing HTML tags.

*Opening tags* tell the browser this is the start of an **HTML element**. They
are comprised of a *keyword* enclosed in angle brackets **<>**. For example, an
opening paragraph tag looks like this: **<p\>**.

*Closing tags*( tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the 
same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash
before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: *</p\>*.

You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and closing
tags tell the browser what content the element contains. The browser can then
use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content.

There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements often
look like this: **<br /\>** or **<img/\>**, but some can also be used without the closing
forward slash such as **<br\>** or **<img\>**. These are known as *self-closing tags*
or *empty elements* because they don't wrap any content.

HTML has a [vast list of predefined tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) that you can use to create all kinds
of different elements. It is import to use the correct tags for content. Using
the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites: how they
are ranked in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on
assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

Using the correct elements for content is called **semantic HTML**.
