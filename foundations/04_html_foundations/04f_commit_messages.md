1. This article, [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit), covers all the main bases on how to write good commit messages. The whole article is great and informative but the meat of the article is “The seven rules of a great commit message.”

#### Tips and Things to Remember:

  - Using VSCode as your text editor (you should have set this up in the Git Basics section) will allow you to easily make multi-line commit messages, easily see the character length of each line, and will allow you to use VSCode spell check extensions to make sure your spelling is correct
  - Use an active voice: “Fix card generator”
  - Avoid using vague commit messages such as “saved” or “updated”
  - Commit early and often!

#### Knowledge Check

  - What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history?
  - How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?
  
#### Additional Resources

  - One way to formulate high information commit messages is to follow a template. [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one of many commit message templates that you can explore.
