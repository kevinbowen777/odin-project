### [Commit Messages](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-commit-messages)

#### Introduction

This lesson will explain the importance of good commit messages, how to write them, when to commit and why having a history of good commits is so important!

#### Lesson Overview

  - How to write a meaningful commit message
  - Why meaningful commit messages are important
  - When to commit
  
#### Are Commit Messages So Important They Deserve Their Own Lesson?



  - When you are applying for jobs, employers will look through your projects on GitHub and they will look through your commit history. Having good commits as a novice developer will help you stand out.

  - Having a good commit message history will allow you (or other developers working on your code) to quickly see what changes were made and why. This is useful if a bug is found in the code that needs to be fixed!

  - Having a good commit message history will also be helpful if you come back to a project you were working on after stepping away from it for a while. You likely won’t remember your thought process and changes made when initially writing out the code.

#### When to Commit

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.

This means, make a commit if you get a piece of code you are working on to function like you want it to, fix a typo, or fix a bug. As you gain experience, you will develop a better feel for what should be committed!

#### Assignment

1. This article, [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit), covers all the main bases on how to write good commit messages. The whole article is great and informative but the meat of the article is “The seven rules of a great commit message.”

#### Tips and Things to Remember:

  - Using VSCode as your text editor (you should have set this up in the Git Basics section) will allow you to easily make multi-line commit messages, easily see the character length of each line, and will allow you to use VSCode spell check extensions to make sure your spelling is correct
  - Use an active voice: “Fix card generator”
  - Avoid using vague commit messages such as “saved” or “updated”
  - Commit early and often!

#### Knowledge Check

  - What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history?
  - How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?
  
#### Additional Resources

  - One way to formulate high information commit messages is to follow a template. [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one of many commit message templates that you can explore.
