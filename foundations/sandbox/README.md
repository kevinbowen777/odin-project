### Odin Project Sandbox

A freeform directory/environment for practicing and testing various features as
they are introduced in the curriculum. The order of the test pages roughly
follows the order of the general curriculum. 

In addition, various other mini-projects/demo have been brought in. Mainly this is for practice, learning, and general messing around outside of the proscribed assignments.

Hopefully, some of of these snippets saved for posterity(!) will be useful for
scraps/parts in future projects.


Using `python -m http.server` to run a local http server may be an option.
Though in initial testing, it looks like I am having some difficulties with
caching stale pages.

Currently, I am just opening up a file locally.
